852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array
You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
Return the index of the peak element.
Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
Solution--
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
      int start =0;
      int end = arr.length-1;
      while(start<end){
        int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
        if(arr[mid]>arr[mid+1]){
            //we are in the desc part of array
            //this maybe the ans but look at left
            //this is why end != mid-1;
            end= mid;

        }else{
            //you are in the asc part of array
            start = mid+1; //because we know that mid+1 element> mid element
        }
      } 
      //start and end are alwasy trying to find the largest element in the above two checks
      //start==end and the lopps break,and we found the max element
      return start; 
      //can also submit return end; as start == end in last
    }
}
