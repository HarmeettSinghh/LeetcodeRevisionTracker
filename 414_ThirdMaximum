Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1

        Long second = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        Long third = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int num: nums){

                continue;
            }else if(num>first){
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first =(long) num;
            }else if(num>second){
                third = second;
                second = (long) num;
            }else if(num>third){
                third = (long)num;
            }
        }
        return third==Long.MIN_VALUE?first.intValue():third.intValue(); //converts long to int value as return type of the function is intrger
    }
}
